Description: SUit of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
 The family of solvers referred to as SUNDIALS consists of solvers CVODE
 (for ODE systems), CVODES (ODE with sensitivity analysis capabilities),
 IDA (for differential-algebraic systems), and KINSOL (for nonlinear
 algebraic systems).
 .
 This package depends on all other packages containing the shared
 libraries for the subcomponents of SUNDIALS: CVODE, CVODES, IDA,
 KINSOL, and NVECTOR_SERIAL.

Architecture: any
Depends: libsundials-serial (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: SUNDIALS development files
 The family of solvers referred to as SUNDIALS (SUit of Nonlinear and
 DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers) consists of solvers CVODE
 (for ODE systems), CVODES (ODE with sensitivity analysis capabilities),
 IDA (for differential-algebraic systems), and KINSOL (for nonlinear
 algebraic systems).
 .
 This package contains files necessary for development applications using
 SUNDIALS in C and, in case of FCVODE and FKINSOL, Fortran.  It also
 contains various example programs distributed by the upstream authors.
