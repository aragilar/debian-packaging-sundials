Description: SUNDIALS development files
 The family of solvers referred to as SUNDIALS (SUit of Nonlinear and
 DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers) consists of solvers CVODE
 (for ODE systems), CVODES (ODE with sensitivity analysis capabilities),
 IDA (for differential-algebraic systems), and KINSOL (for nonlinear
 algebraic systems).
 .
 This package contains files necessary for development applications using
 SUNDIALS in C and, in case of FCVODE and FKINSOL, Fortran.
